                    Welcome to the temple city of Myanmar. You can fly to Bagan from any of the international airports of the country. Bagan is also well connected by train and road to the rest of the country. If you are travelling from Mandalay and have extra time in hand, we recommend taking the boat from Mandalay to Bagan. Every minute spent on the river will be worthwhile.
                    Once you’re settled in your hotel, freshen up and head to Ananda Temple, the most stunning temple in Bagan. You can also see Mingala Zedi Paya and Gubyaukgyi Temple today. Enjoy a nice local lunch at any of the food shops. End the day with a visit to the night market. You might be able to see a local entertainment programme at the market.

                    If you want to enjoy a hot air balloon ride in Bagan, today is the day to do it. You’ll have to book the ticket in advance and wake up really early. In case you don’t plan to ride a hot air balloon, you can visit Shwesandaw Pagoda at around 6 AM to enjoy a stunning sunrise. Head back to the hotel after seeing the sunrise. After breakfast, set off on a temple tour. You can hire a taxi or e-bike to do this. Some of the places you can visit today are Gawdaw Palin, Dhammayan Gyi Temple, Sulamani Temple and Bagan Archaeological Museum.
                    Travelling in the sun the whole day will tire you. We recommend taking it light in the evening, visiting the market and gorging on some delicious local food.

                    On your final day, visit Mount Popa, which is located only one and a half hours away from Bagan. You can climb to the top of a volcanic plug where the Popa Taung Kalat Monastery is located. The hike is not very tough and will take 30 to 45 minutes. The way up is enchanting, taking you through the jungles where you will see evidence of animistic worship.
                    After the visit, head back to Bagan and enjoy a nice lunch. You can then visit other temples around Bagan, including Htilominlo Pagoda, Upali Thein Pagoda, Nat Taung Kyaung Monastery and Maha Bodhi Phaya. End the day by enjoying the sunset from Pyathetgyi Pagoda.
